Reflection on CS300 Projects.

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?


While completing the prep and final projects for this course, the main problem that I focused on solving was writing efficient code that managed and displayed information about computer science course data that was given to me. The goals were to read course data from a file, create/choose the best data structure to store this information, sort the courses alphabetically, and provide a user-friendly interface for easy access that displayed the correct course details.

When first approaching these problems, I learned about each individual data structure and then conducted a runtime and memory analysis of all 3, considering factors like reading files, creating course objects, and searching for course information. The 3 data structures I was comparing were vectors, hash tables, and balanced binary search trees. This analysis helped me to choose the hash table as the more logical data structure for my project, offering fast data retrieval and more efficient memory usage.

When I ran into an issue or roadblock, I tried my best to follow an organized development process. I started with defining the Courses class to store course information and prerequisites if they had any. I then implemented a function to load data from a file into a hash table, emaking sure to include error handling for invalid file formats. I then created a seperate function that would allow users to print course details based on their input, and then finally created a function to sort and print the course list alphabetically.Anytime that I would get stuck in my process I would go back in the course material or prep projects to guide me past the problem. If I ran into an issue that was not based on the material we were learning I would use stack overflow or google to get the help I needed.

These projects expanded my approach to software design and development by showing me the importance of selecting the right data structure for the task at hand. Understanding data structures and their performance characteristics is crucial for making the best informed decision in software development. It taught me that the choice of data structure can significantly alter the efficiency and scalability of a program. The work on these projects has also enhanced my programming practices. I learned the significance of creating modular and well-structured code. The use of classes and functions improved code maintainability and readability. By organizing code into separate files, such as Courses.h and Courses.cpp, I made the program more adaptable and the code resusable. I also made sure to use good coding practices such as informative variable names, comments, and easy to use user interfaces, ensuring that the code I created was easily understandable and maintainable.

These projects addressed the challenge of creating a program that manages information from a file and then gives the user options through a mnu to pull out what they would like from the file data. These projects were not just about writing a program but it also taught me to shop around with different types of data structures to find the one that fits best. On top of that these projects gave me the opportunity to increase my skills of creating pseudocode for programs which was one of my weak points going into this class. I was able to create an easy to use and adaptable program that met the criteria I was given by using data structure analysis, pseudocode, structured development, and best coding practices.
